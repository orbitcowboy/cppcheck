<h1>Cppcheck GUI</h1>

<p>With the Cppcheck GUI you can analyze your code.</p>

<h2>Quick walk through</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create a project.</h3>

<p>Create a new project.</p>

<p>In the <i>Paths and Defines</i> tab, it is recommended that you import your project file at the top.</p>

<p>In the <i>Types and Functions</i> tab, try to activate all 3rd party libraries you use (windows, posix, ...).</p>

<p>In the <i>Analysis</i> tab, leave the default settings to start with.</p>

<p>In the <i>Warnings options</i> tab, leave the default settings to start with.</p>

<p>In the <i>Addons</i> tab, leave the default settings to start with.</p>


<h3>Step 2: Analyze code.</h3>

<p>When the project file has been created, the analysis will start automatically.</p>

<p>While analysis is performed in the background, you can investigate the warnings.</p>


<h3>Step 3: Investigate warnings.</h3>

<p>In the toolbar you choose what types of warnings you want to see (error/warning/style/performance/portability/information).</p>

<p>All warnings are shown in a list. If you select a warning in the list, then details about that warning is shown below the list.</p>

<p>If you right click on warning(s) then you get a context menu.</p>


<h3>Step 4: Configuration.</h3>

<p>It is possible to improve configuration to get better analysis. The automatic assumptions are conservative and through configuration those automatic assumptions can be avoided.</p>
